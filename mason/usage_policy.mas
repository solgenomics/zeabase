<h3>Toronto Agreement</h3>

<h4>Rapid prepublication data release should be encouraged for projects with the following attributes:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Large scale (requiring significant resources over time)</li>
<li>Broad utility</li>
<li>Creating reference data sets</li>
<li>Associated with community buy-in</li>
</ul>

<h4>Funding agencies should facilitate the specification of data-release policies for relevant projects by:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Explicitly informing applicants of data-release requirements, especially mandatory prepublication data release</li>
<li>Ensuring that evaluation of data release plans is part of the peer-review process</li>
<li>Proactively establishing analysis plans and timelines for projects releasing data prepublication</li>
<li>Fostering investigator-initiated prepublication data release</li>
<li>Helping to develop appropriate consent, security, access and governance mechanisms that protect research participants while encouraging prepublication data release</li>
<li>Providing long-term support of databases</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data producers should state their intentions and enable analyses of their data by:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Informing data users about the data being generated, data standards and quality, planned analyses, timelines, and relevant contact information, ideally through publication of a citable marker paper near the start of the project or by provision of a citable URL at the project or funding-agency website</li>
<li>Providing relevant metadata (e.g., questionnaires, phenotypes, environmental conditions, and laboratory methods) that will assist other researchers in reproducing and/or independently analysing the data, while protecting interests of individuals enrolled in studies focusing on humans</li>
<li>Ensuring that research participants are informed that their data will be shared with other scientists in the research community</li>
<li>Publishing their initial global analyses, as stated in the marker paper or citable URL, in a timely fashion</li>
<li>Creating databases designed to archive all data (including underlying raw data) in an easily retrievable form and facilitate usage of both pre-processed and processed data</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data analysts/users should freely analyse released prepublication data and act responsibly in publishing analyses of those data by:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Respecting the scientific etiquette that allows data producers to publish the first global analyses of their data set</li>
<li>Reading the citeable document associated with the project</li>
<li>Accurately and completely citing the source of prepublication data, including the version of the data set (if appropriate)</li>
<li>Being aware that released prepublication data may be associated with quality issues that will be later rectified by the data producers</li>
<li>Contacting the data producers to discuss publication plans in the case of overlap between planned analyses</li>
<li>Ensuring that use of data does not harm research participants and is in conformity with ethical approvals</li>
<li>Scientific journal editors should engage the research community about issues related to prepublication data release and provide guidance to authors and reviewers on the third-party use of prepublication data in manuscripts</li>
</ul>
