As another example, the dbReadTable function performs simple SE-
LECT queries that mimics the R counterpart ’get.’ That is, dbReadTable
imports the Allstar table from the database into R as a data frame, using
the attribute PlayerID as the row.names for the data frame.
dbReadTable(con, "Allstar", row.names = "PlayerID")
Other RMySQL functions are dbWriteTable, dbExistsTable, and dbRe-
moveTable, which are equivalent to the R functions ’assign’, ’exists’, and
’remove’, respectively.
Other queries can be executed by supplying the SQL statement. For
example, to perform a simple aggregate query, there is no need to pull a
database table into R and apply an R function to the data frame. Instead,
we issue a select statement and retrieve the results table as a data frame.
Below is an example where we obtain the number of tuples in the Allstar
table of BaseballDataBank.
dbGetQuery(con,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Allstar;")
When the result table is huge, we may not want to bring it into R in
its entirety, but instead fetch the tuples in batches, possibly reducing the
batches to simple summaries before requesting the next batch. We p
